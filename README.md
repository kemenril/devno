# devno
Linux kernel module that provides /dev/no

This is a simple Linux character device, written on a lark.  Every time you 
open it, it writes a string out in the form of "Noooooooooooo..." ad infinitum.
Someone asked me for it as an example, so here it is.  It's not very useful, but
it's loads of fun.
